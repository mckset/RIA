		<h2 id="loc">Locations</h2>
		<p>
			Displays a list of saved locations. Locations point to folders of images that you want to use as references. From this view, you can select images place them on the board.
			Pressing the "+" button will bring up a file explorer for you to select the folder you want to add.
		</p>
		<img src="help/Locview.png">
		
		<p>
			New locations are displayed in a list. Clicking the head of a location will expand its contents. If you press the delete key while hovering over a main folder, it will remove it from the list.
		</p>

		<img src="help/Locview2.png">
		<p>
			Note that folders have a black backing to the and files don't. Clicking on a file will add it to the image preview where you can place on the board by clicking or add it to a tag.
		</p>
		<img src="help/Locview3.png">
		<p>
			If the image is already tagged, it will display a white indicator by the file name in the file browser.
		</p>
		<img src="help/Locview4.png">

		<br><br><br><br>
		<h2 id="tag">Tags</h2>
		<p>
			Tags allow you to organize large groups of images outside of folders. Clicking the "+" button will add a new tag.
		</p>
		<img src="help/Tagview.png">
		<p>
			Clicking the on the name will let you edit it. The three sliders change the tags background color. The confirm button will submit the tag and the delete button will cancel.
		</p>
		<img src="help/Tageditor.png">

		<p>
			The same principle applies to tags where clicking on them will expand their contents. Clicking on a image in the tag will add it to the preview where you click it on the board. Pressing the edit button on a tag will bring up the previous menu but pressing delete will remove the tag from the list. You can also remove a tag by hovering over it and pressing the delete key. If you press the "+" button on a tag, it will add a sub tag to the main tag.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two ways to add an image to a tag. The first is to load an image into the preview (either by clicking on an image in the locations or tag menus) and right clicking the tag you want to add it to. The other way is to select the image and right click it and use the tag menu to add it to a tag. Doing the same to an already tagged image will remove it from the tag. Note that if an image is tagged, a white square appear by the tag it belongs to.

		<h2>Image Packs</h2>
		<p>
			Image packs are an experimental idea only found in RIA. An image pack contains pre-tagged files so they can easily be shared between users. Image packs are stored in the "shared" folder.
			Clicking import while an image pack is selected will display the folders that the image pack uses.
		</p>
		<img src="help/Imgpack2.png">
		<p>
			The folders in an image pack are mostly used like categories. By selecting a folder, the user can choose what kind of images they want to import. In this case, the user doesn't want to import cartoon images but wants the photos and ink images.
		</p>
		<img src="help/Imgpack3.png">
		<p>
			After pressing import folders, the program will display all the tags and subtags that the image pack will create. 
			While the "Include Subtags" button is highlighted, the program will include the subtags in the image pack.
			Otherwise it will ignore subtags.
		</p>

		<h2>Creating an Image pack</h2>
		<p>
			To create an image pack, create a folder in the "shared" folder of RIA and give it the name of your image pack.
			Add subfolders to the image pack to categorize the images you want to used.
			Move the images to the subfolders and the open RIA.
			Add your image pack to the locations view and tag your images as you want them to be imported.
			After tagging all your images, open the image pack window, click on your image pack, and then press create.
			RIA will store the tag information for all the images in your image pack in the "import.dat" file.
			Sharing the image pack with other users will let them import your files with the tags you gave it.
